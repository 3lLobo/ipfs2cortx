### Cortx IPFS Bridge

This web(3) app provides a bridge between IPFS with it's incentive-layer blockchain FileCoin and the massive-data storage system CORTX.

Main Features:
    - Inspect CID content if available âœ… 
    - fetch data from IPFS through it's CID âœ…
    - deploy to CORTX file-system using S3 interface ðŸ“¦
    - List deployed files from CORTX file-system ðŸ“¦
    - authenticate using FileCoin ðŸ“¦
    - assign user-specific bucket ðŸ“¦
    - invert bridge ðŸ“¦


## Get Started ðŸš€

Spin up an IPFS deamon:

```bash
ipfs daemon
```

Make sure your CORTX cluster is running and available. In case of [cloudshare](https://use.cloudshare.com/Authenticated/Landing.aspx?s=1), log in to your account.

## IPFS

Two options available to fetch files over IPFS.

### Browser

Starts an IPFS node inside the browser. This takes considerably longer than the second option. Further, the node is node not closed properly when closing the tap and might not clean up configuration files. File size might be limited by browser configurations.

### HTTP client

Connects to a running local IPFS node on port 5001. This option is faster, more stable and doens't limit file size. User must run a local instance of IPFS.

To spin up an IPFS node on the browser, use the `create()` from ipfs-core.
To connect to a running node on localhost, use the ipfs-http-client library like [here](https://github.com/ipfs/js-ipfs/tree/master/packages/ipfs-http-client)

The browser extension can not be connected to as it runs in Braves native IPFS mode, which refuses API connections.
Switching this to `local` will make it connectable.
